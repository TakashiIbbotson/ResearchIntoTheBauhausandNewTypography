<p>László Moholy-Nagy became the instructor of the foundation course at the Bauhaus replacing Johannes Itten in 1923.  Although originally studying law Maholy-Nagy moved on to explore painting, photography, film, sculpture, and graphic design.
He researched and designed a connection between typography and photography and this was the beginning of what has become the central medium of Graphic Design.
"Typography is communication composed in type. Photography is the visual presentation of what can be optically apprehended. Typophoto is the visually most exact rendering of communication."Moholy-Nagy, along with Tschichold and Schwitters, attempted to articulate the 'New Typography'. In 1923 he published an article in which he defended the notion that "typography is an instrument of communication and must be as clear and effective as possible."</p>

<p>Weimar-1919 to 1925 – Was originally designed by Henry Van de Velde but was replaced with Walter Gropius who re-organised it under the Bauhaus – School of Design.
Dessau -1925 to 1932 – Walter Gropius.
Berlin from 1932 to 1933 - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
Dessau – Gropius's design took a futuristic approach.  He led the school for only 3 years before resigning and letting  Hannes Meyer take his position as director.  The heavy industry surrounding the school could participate in the production of textiles, home appliances, accessories and furniture that the school was known for designing. He was fired in the summer of 1930 when his political beliefs were coming dangerously close to threatening the existence of the school and the council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested Ludwig Mies van der Rohe who then took charge of the school and moved it to Berlin.
